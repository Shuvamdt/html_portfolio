<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Shuvam Dutta and I am currently studying computer science engineering at UEM Kolkata.
</p>
<p>
  Since writing my first line of code, I have been deeply fascinated by technology.
  My eagerness to learn continuously motivates me to explore new technologies and undertake various coding projects.
  I have recently completed studying Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.
  While I may have some skill gaps, my unwavering commitment to learning makes up for them.

  Besides tech stuff, I love traveling, whipping up some grub on weekends, and jamming on the guitar.
